Card Deck
==============

The idea is to represent a 'standard' deck of cards ; this will be practice for enums, structs and methods.

A card has a _suit_ (one of Diamonds, Hearts, Cubs and Spades), and a _rank_ (A, numbers 2-10, J, Q, K)

* Create an Enum called Suit for the suits
* Create an Enum called Rank for the ranks
* Create a struct called Card, with public properties suit and rank, of the above types.
	* Create a public constructor, that takes a rank and a suit (in that order) and builds the card. Use default parameters so that by default it builds an A of Hearts
